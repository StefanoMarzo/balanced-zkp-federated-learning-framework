### Practicum Topic
Development of a data analysis tool integrated into a data governance platform that produces metadata about the fairness of a federated dataset. The metadata created can be used to classify data more accurately by reducing bias related to the presence of minority groups within the dataset. The project, motivated by recent scientific results, aims to implement unfairness quantification as part of the fundamental principles described in the Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI authored by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) on behalf of the European Commission.
### Research Questions
- To what extent can we mitigate federated data bias by using data governance systems according to EU guidelines for data ethics and trustworthy AI?
- To what extent can zero knowledge proof metadata about the proportions of population clusters generated in a federated learning environment can be used to enhance trustworthiness in AI?
